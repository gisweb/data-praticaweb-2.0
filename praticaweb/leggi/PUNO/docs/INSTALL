Installation (Using Oo SDK 3.x)

1. Install OpenOffice.org 3.x and OpenOffice.org SDK 3.x

If you do not have OpenOffice.org installed yet, download it from http://www.openoffice.org/ (recommended) or install it from your Linux/Unix distribution binary packages (not recommended).

Download the SDK from http://download.openoffice.org/other.html#tested-sdk and save it in /usr/src/, for example. Then you must extract and install the RPM or DEB files.

For example, In Ubuntu, with SDK version 3.2.1:
# cd /usr/src/
# tar zxvf OOo-SDK_3.2.1_Linux_x86_install-deb_en-US.tar.gz
# cd OOO320_m18_native_packed-1_en-US.9502/DEBS/
# dpkg -i ooobasis3.2-sdk_3.2.1-18_i386.deb

This will install the SDK 3.2.1 in /opt/openoffice.org/basis3.2/sdk/.


2. Execute setsdkenv_unix

Run the shell script <OPENOFFICE_SDK_PATH>/setsdkenv_unix. If this is the first time you are running the script, then you'll be prompted to answer some questions about your OpenOffice installation.
It's required to run setsdkenv_unix before every attempt to compile PHP with UNO support. This script "prepares" the environment so that your C++ compiler can find headers, libs and other required files from the OpenOffice.org SDK.

# cd <OPENOFFICE_SDK_PATH>
#./setsdkenv_unix

A few problems may occur when mixing the sdk with a distribution version of the OpenOffice suite. Distros, like Ubuntu for example, choose to place files in a different hierarchy than the original package would do.
This results in the setsdkenv_unix script not being able to locate or correctly set the environment variables needed to build Puno or any other OpenOffice UNO applications.

As a workaround, you must edit the generated script located at $HOME/$OO_SDK_NAME/$HOSTNAME/setsdkenv_unix.sh and ensure that all required variables are set and pointing to the correct paths or values described bellow:

Name 			Recommend Value				Description
OO_SDK_NAME 		openoffice.org3.2_sdk 			The SDK name.
OO_SDK_HOME		'/opt/openoffice.org/basis3.2/sdk' 	Installation directory of the Software Development Kit.
OFFICE_HOME 		'/usr/lib/openoffice' 			Office installation directory.
OFFICE_BASE_HOME	$OFFICE_HOME/basis3.2 			Office Base installation directory.
OO_SDK_URE_HOME 	'/usr/lib/ure' 				URE installation directory.
OO_URE_TYPES_RDB_PATH 	$OO_SDK_URE_HOME/share/misc/types.rdb 	This is PUNO specific. It identifies a rdb file containg services and types definitions.


Name	 			Recommend Value					Description
OO_PROGRAM_OFFAPI_RDB_PATH 	$OFFICE_HOME/basis3.2/program/offapi.rdb 	This is PUNO specific. It identifies a rdb file containg services and types definitions.


4. Download and extract Puno source

Download Puno source from here and extract it to a directory, /usr/src/ for example.
It's assumed that you already have PHP and Apache ( if required ) installed and their respectives development files (utils, headers and libs).



5. Phpize Puno

Go to Puno's source directory and execute phpize to "prepare" the module for building.
# cd <PUNO_SOURCE_PATH>
# phpize

The phpize command is used to prepare the build environment for a PHP extension. It's part of PHP's development package. If you do not have it installed, then you can not build modules for PHP on your machine. Visit http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.pecl.phpize.php for more information.



6. Configure Puno

# ./configure --with-puno=<OPENOFFICE_SDK_PATH>



7. Build automatic generated headers and Puno

# make cppumaker
# make all

If you are using a distro Openoffice package, you may have to manually create symbolic links to the shared libraries in the URE lib folder "$OO_SDK_URE_HOME/lib".
"$OO_SDK_URE_HOME/lib" is the directory containing files like libuno_cppuhelpergcc3.so.3, libuno_cppu.so.3, libuno_purpenvhelpergcc3.so.3, libuno_salhelpergcc3.so.3, libuno_sal.so.3.

Link them using the following commands:

# cd $OO_SDK_URE_HOME/lib
# for i in $(ls *.so?* ); do ln -s $i `echo $i | cut -f1 -d.`.so; done



8. Install files in PHP modules' directory

# make install

Then, add the following line into your php.ini:

extension=puno.so

Also, consider that you may have to configure the php.ini's extension_dir directive so that it points to the PHP's extensions directory.




9. Configure WebServer or Shell startup scripts

A PHP process, either in a webserver or standalone, requires a great amount of OpenOffice.org libraries (shared objects - .so) in order to load Puno and the UNO API. In a standard system, the O.S. will load these files automatically if they are located in /lib,/usr/lib,/usr/local/lib, etc.

However, this is not the location for some openoffice libs, so you need to manually set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH or change /etc/ld.so.conf to add these files' directories to the library search path.
To do so, run the following lines before starting the web server or add them to its startup script (/etc/init.d/apache2):
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$OO_SDK_HOME/lib:$OFFICE_BASE_PROGRAM_PATH:\ $OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH:$OO_SDK_URE_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Note that the setsdkenv_unix variables' $OO_SDK_HOME, $OFFICE_BASE_PROGRAM_PATH, $OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH and $OO_SDK_URE_HOME must be set prior to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
You can obtain their values from $HOME/$OO_SDK_NAME/$HOSTNAME/setsdkenv_unix.sh .

This is required so that your webserver can 'find' OpenOffice.org libraries in order to use the UNO API.



10. Restart the WebServer (if required)

Restart your webserver if you are using one.
